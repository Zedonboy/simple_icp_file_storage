The second Questions

## Question: How would you create this architecture?

1. Implement File Storage APIs in a canister  for the user operations
2. Compile the canister to WASM
3. hardcode the WASM bytes array into the Master canister 

## Question: How would you receive ICP and use it?

1. I will generate an ICP address for the user, so user can send ICP
2. When the user sends ICP, the user notifies the Master canister.
3. Master canister verifies if the user sent lCP to that address
4. The canister use this ICP tokens to create cycles for the user canisters

## Question: How would you create canisters on demand?

1. After Master canister verifies ICP payments
2. It will make [API](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk/latest/ic_cdk/api/management_canister/main/index.html) call to create Canister, using its principal and user principal as controllers and depositing cycles into it.
3. Then use the hard coded WASM byte array, to make [INSTALL_CODE API call](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk/latest/ic_cdk/api/management_canister/main/fn.install_code.html)
4. Then save the user principal associated with their own Canister id

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd hurtado_test/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
